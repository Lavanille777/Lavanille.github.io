- No one in the room that night knew the shut-down button could act as a detonator.They didn't know it. because it was kept from them.
- comrade Legasov, you are contradicting your own testimony in Vienna.
- My testimony in Vienna was a lie. I lied to the world.
- I'm not the only one who kept these secrets, There are many. We were following orders, from the KGB, from the Central Committee. And right now, there are 16 reactors in the Soviet Union with this same fatal flaw. Three of them are still running less than twenty kilometers away at Chernobyl.
- Professor Legasov, if you mean to suggest the Soviet State is somehow responsible for what happened, then I must warn you, you're treading on dangerous ground.
- I've already trod on dangerous ground. We're on dangerous ground right now because of our secrets and our lies. They are practically what defines us. When the truth offends, we lie and lie until we can no longer remember it's even there, but it is still there. Every lie we tell incurs as a debt to truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid. That is how an RBMK reactor core explodes. Lies.
